# Monome

## Setup

#### Download serialosc
Cnce installed, serialosc will always be running. device connection and disconnection is automatically detected.

when reconnected, the previous sessions settings (rotation & port routing) will be restored. if your device is disconnected during a performance, plug it back in to resume at the same place as before.

Your target application (polygome for example) will have a device selection menu, which will be auto-populated with connected devices. you will need to “focus” the device on your app by selecting it from the dropdown or pressing 'connect'.
