# Calisthenics

Form of excercise consisting of a variety of exercises, often rhythmical movements. Generally without the use of equitment. They build functional strength. When you do bodyweight excercies you force your body to use more supporting wright and balancing muscles then you would on a machine.

## Upper Body

#### Pushup

1. Facing the ground adopt a position as shown where your body is straight and only your hands are feet are touching the ground (arms straight) - arms slightly wider than shoulder width.
2. Lower your body by bendig your arms (hands still in same place) until your chest is nearly touching the floor, then pause for a second.
3. Raise your body by straightening your arms until your arms are nearly straight, pause for a second then go back to 2.

Exhale as you go up, and inhale as you lower your body.
If you can't do a full push-up, do them on your knees, such that in the starting position, your body is resting on your hands and knees instead of your hands and feet. 
##### Diamond Pushup

This is very similar to a pressup except you place your hands in a diamond formation (thumb tips and index finger tips touching) under the centre of your chest which emphasises work on the tricep. 

#### Reverse Push Up

1. Sit on a bar or chair (or the floor if you really have no platform to use).
2. Grab the side or back and lower yourself down and up. 

I recommend doing them slowly or try with one hand for a bit of variety, a good exercise straight ater a set of pressups for some added endurance. 

#### Forearm Roller 

Obtain a dowel wood approx 2 inches thickor more, drill a hole through and centre and put some sturdy string through it (or you can try fishing wire), start off with a 5kg weight on the end.

Keeping your elbows locked to your sides and arms directly in front of your elbows, palms facing down, hold the roller and roll the weight up to the top, then down till it's nearly touching the floor, try and do this for a few reps (3+) - you'll be amazed how quickly you progress, I was lifting 20kg within a month. 


#### Shoulder Press

1. Get into the normal press up position.
2. Move your hands and feet closer together so your body forms a V-shape.
3. Raise and lower yourself, you should feet the emphasis on your shoulders and triceps. 

To make the exercise harder you can put your feet on a high object (as shown below) or put a few books under each hand so you can go lower into the exercise and have a fuller range of movement. 

#### Shoulder Circles Exercise

Not that difficult to do, just put your hands out to the sides or directly in front of you then draw circles with your hands in the air. Try going one way then the other, then small circles, then big circles, some slow and some fast. 

#### Handstand Push Up

1. Get yourself into the position shown in the picture by putting your feet against a post or wall.
2. Raise and lower your body, you should feel a good workout on your shoulders and triceps. 

If you have trouble starting out, try doing half reps (ie. only doing the top half of the exercise) or try shoulder press ups until you can manage handstand pressups. 

#### Pull Ups / Chin Ups

Pull ups have your palms facing your body. Do the full range of motion. For added dificulty spread your grip wider on the bar.

Chin Ups have your palms facing away from your body. 

#### One Arm Hang

This is mainly for building grip strength. At least a minute.


##Core

#### The Plank

For this exercise you lie on your front, then lift yourself up to that the only part of your body touching the floor are your toes and forearms as shown in the picture, you then hold the position for as long as possible (minimum 1 minute). Make sure your body is pretty much straight and your midection is not too high in the air. 

Alternatively you can hold this position for a slow count of 5-10, then relax for 1-2 seconds, then repeat - do this 12 times and you have completed 1 set. 

#### Stomach Crunch

1. Lie on your back.
2. Bring your feet closer to your body so your knees are raised off the ground (nb. by varying the distances between your feet and body you can vary which parts of your abs the exercise focuses on).
3. Put you hands either side of your head (or fold across your chest) ensuring you do not put them behind your head as this will put unnecessary pressure on your neck.
4. Slowly lift your upper body off the ground (your upper body should curl up as opposed to keeping your upper body straight and lifting at the waist only).
5. Lower your body back down and repeat - do not let your head or shoulders touch the floor at any time during the exercise as this takes exercise off the abs. 

#### Ab stomach Chops

1. Lie on your back.
2. Brind your arms up so you are resting on your forearms as shown on the pictures.
3. Keeping your legs straight, lift one up and down, as one leg is going up the other should be going down. Make sure you do not touch the floor with any part of your leg or feet during the exercise. 

#### Knees to Chest 

First lie on your back, then cross your arms over your chest:
1. Bring your knees up towards your chest, simultaneously curl your chest forward so that your chest and knees nearly meet at the middle.
2. Push your feet our as you lower your upper body.
3. Repeat - make sure at no time during the exercise do your feet or shoulders touch the ground as it takes stress away from your abs.

#### Hyperextension back Exercise


Lie flat on the floor, face down, with your hands either behind your back resting on your lower back (or else by the side of your head as shown). 

Now using your lower back muscles, lift your upper body off the ground as shown and hold for a slow count of 5 then relax, now repeat this at least 10 times. 

#### Jack Knife

Get in the position shown in 1, lift your upperbody and legs off the ground, hold the position shown in 2 for a second before relaxing, do not allow your head or legs to touch the floor at any point during the set. 

## Lower Body

####B asic Leg Squate

Stand in position shown, keep wider than shoulder width apart, toes facing slightly out for balance then bend your knees keeping your back straight until your thighs are parallel with the floor then straight your legs and stand up again. Perform the exercise slowly and do not bounce at the bottom of the exercise. Keep hands held yout in front of you for balance or cross them across your chest. 

For a bit of variety either perform the exercise very slowly or very quickly so that you jump a few inches off the ground at the top of every movement. 

#### Lunge Leg Exercise

Stand up straight as in pic 1, then step forward with one of your legs and bend your knee as in pic 2. Do not allow your knee to come further forward than your foot, then straighten your leg and step back (Pic 2 will be upgraded as soon as I can borrow a digital camera!). Alternate legs each time.
