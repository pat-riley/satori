#Economic Schools of THought

##Austrian Economics

*A school of economic thought that is based on the analysis of the purposeful actions of individuals*


>the subjective choices of individuals underlie all economic phenomena”


###Fundamental Tenets


#####Methodical Individualism
View that social phenomena can only be understood by examining how they result from the motivations and actions of individual agents. Groups or “collectives” cannot act except through the actions of individual members. 


#####Methodical Subjectivism
The knowledge that individuals have or perceive to have, expectations people have regarding external developments, and the perceived consequences of their own actions.

#####Tastes and Preferences
Subjective valuations of goods and services determine the demand for them so that their prices are influenced by consumers.

#####Opportunity Costs
The costs with which producers and other economic actors calculate reflect the alternative opportunities that must be foregone; as productive services are employed for one purpose.

#####Marginalism
In all economic designs, the values, costs, revenues, productivity, are all determined by the significance of the last united subtracted from the total.

###Oppositions

Austrians are often averse to the use of mathematics and statistics in economics
