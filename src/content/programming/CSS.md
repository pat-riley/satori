##Transitions

CSS transitions are a part of CSS3 set of specifications. They provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties.

Animations that involve transitioning between two states are often called *implicit transitions* as the states in betwen the start and final states are implicitly defined by the browser.

	div {
		transition: <property> <duration> <timing-function> <delay>;
	}
