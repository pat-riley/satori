#Cognitive Ergonomics

##Summary

Cognitive Ergonomics (CE) is concerned with mental processes, such as perception, memory, reasoning, and motor responses as they affect interactions among humans and and other elements of a system.

Topics include
* mental workload
* decision-making
* skilled performance
* human computer interactionÂ
* human reliabillity
* work stress

CE studies cognition in work and operational settings in order to optimize human well-being and system performace.

Ergonomics is sometimes described as “fitting the system to the human,” meaning that through informed decisions; equipment, tools, environments and tasks can be selected and designed to fit unique human abilities and limitations.

A typical example in physical ergonomics is adjusting a lifting job to occur at waist height, to concur with the natural pivot point of the human hip.

Cognitive ergnonimcs on the other hand focuses on the fit between human cognitive abilities and limitations and the machine, task, environment. Examples include designing software interface to be "easy to use," or desigining a sign so that the majority of people will understand it.

Complex automated systems create interesting design challenges, and reserach and post accident analysis indicate that the human role in automated systems must be closely considered. Automation can result in increased operator monitoring, complex descision making, and other issues that can increase the likeluhood of errors and accidents.
