## HTTP

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.

HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.

A web browser may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a web site may be the server.

Example: A client (browser) submits an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client. The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content.

### HTTP status code

Below is a listing of the HTTP status codes. These codes enable a client accessing another computer or device over HTTP to know how to proceed or not proceed.

### Two HTTP request Methods

#####Get
Request data from a specified resource

#####Post
Submits data to be processed to a specified resource

## SMTP

The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is used to send mail form one machine to another. 

## FTP 

Network Protocol used to transfer computer files from one host to another host over TCP based network (such as internet)
