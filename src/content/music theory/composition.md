#Composition

##Basics

###Foreground vs Background
- human perception happens on multiple levels, and our attention is not equal
- prioritization is ongoing, and can change accidentally

Foreground - element in a multi-layered texture that most engages the listeners attention

Background - secondary elements 

Specifics on foreground or background can get complex, normally it is easy to define.

Orchestral Balance - nothing more than learning to predict what will dominate the texture in a given combination


Factors that the ear follows...
* The top - ear easily grasps textures of extremes then the middle
* Action - elements with most activity attracts attention.in textures consisting of held notes and moving lines, moving takes precedence
* Novelty - when presented with familiar and new material at the same time, new material demands more attention
* Loudness or timbral richness - if playing lines of equal complexity in same register, loudness wins


Possible simple curiosity plays an important role here: in trying to follow the music the listeners tends to focus on the things which require the most effort

Biologicaly this would make sense. An organism needs to make sense of what is going on around it and might concentrates on the area presenting the most information to decipher.

Difference between visual and auditory information in music - although a violin note may be dwarfed on the page by the other instruments, when heard the unpredictable vibrator and constantly evolving dynamics will capture the listeners attention


###Flow vs. Break - Continuity vs Surprise

>“ convincing continuity : one must have that above all other things” - Elliott Carter

####Musical Unity and Variety
- It is convention to speak of unity and variety as the cornerstones of artistic structure
- Unity is difficult to notion in music because it relays on memory
- Temporal nature of music does not permit perception of the whole, except in retrospect (or as experience spreads out over time)
- Music depends on web of memories and associations that gets richer as piece progresses

Therefore, unity is therefore required on at least two levels
- local flow (convincing connection of one event to the next)
- long range association


Sucesseion of musical Ideas can be understood on a continuum of various degrees of continuity
- smoothest flow
- most abrupt change

Unity and variety thus emerge not as two separate phenomena, but as different degrees of the same thing

Composers first and foremost problem is therefore to ensure that the overall flow of the piece, from beginning to end. However, the degree of novelty must be varied at different points.


The key to controlling this balance (between emphasizing common elements and introducing novelty) lies in the interaction of the perceptual levels described above.
- if novel elements are very salient, the effect will be one of contrast
- if chaining elements are more subtle the listener will sense gradual evolution, or relative stability

####Elements that create Connection / Novelty
* Register
* Speed (note values and harmonic rhythm)
* Motives 
* Timbre

Articulation is necessary!
     - listeners cannot grasp or remember that which has no boundaries

* Rate of Presentation is important!
     - speed at which new elements arrive, prominence of the changes
     - important psychological considerations
          - quicker introduction = excitement
          - slower pacing = relaxing



####Stability vs Instability

Example: passage from Beethoven Piano Sonata on page 14

It is unresolved and downright hard to grasp
- tonally roving and unstable
- many ideas presented in short time, texture is varied
- ideas are juxtaposed rather suddenly, very little transition


Compared to the Last example
- one key
- harmonys direction is always clear
- 8th note rhythm is continuous
- much higher degree of predictability

The issue is largely one of predictability

Unstable structures “heighten the temperature and this supply greater intensity.More abrupt, surprising succession of ideas, ideally depend for their coherence on the listens priro familiarity with the material

####Progression

To give music an overall sense of direction, often its evolution takes the form of progression. It is an important tool for creating expectations, and therefore tension

Progression - any incremental series of events that are the same type over a limited time span. It is easily perceptible to the listener as moving in a continuos gradation
ex: series of rising high notes in a melody

Progressions give listeners a point of reference, and encourages project of the musics trend into the future. 

In short, he creates expectations
- actual course of the music is then compared by the listener with these expectations
- if they are met, psychological tension decreases
- if they are not met, psychological tension increases

Effective way to use progressions is to create predictability on a higher level
- leaving details less obviously organized
	-ex: complex melodic line, successive peaks might rise progressively higher
- the relationship between peaks would provide clear direction and coherence
- while the details would provide interest and novelly

####Momentum

Momentum - tendency of music to continue in a given direction. Crucial Aspect of Musical Direction

Momentum also acts on a rhymic levelonce a rhythmic activity is attained, it is hard to abruptly change without some punctuating event)
