#Aikido

##Summary

Aikido is a Japanese martial arts style focused on redirecting the attack away from you.

This martial arts style involves grabs, strikes, throws, pins and joint locks.

###Description

According to the Aikido Association of America, Aikido practices "techniques against a variety of attacks such as kicks, punches, strikes, single-hand or two-hand grabs from the front or rear, chokes, multiple person attacks, and attacks with weapons.

In all of these we strive to resolve the conflict in a non-lethal, non-disruptive, yet effective manner. Techniques may end in joint locks or immobilizations, or in dynamic motions where the attacker is thrown forwards or backwards across the mat, or through the air into a spectacular breakfall. Rather than primarily linear motions, Aikido is comprised of blending, turning, pivoting, circling, and spiraling.

###History
According to United States Aikido Federation, "Aikido was developed by Morihei Ueshiba. To practitioners of Aikido he is more commonly known as O-Sensei (“Great Teacher”). O-Sensei was born on December 14, 1883 in Tanabe City, Japan. As a young man he explored many martial arts including judo, kendo and jujitsu. In 1912, he and his wife, Hatsu, moved to Hokkaido where he began studying Daito-ryu jujitsu under the guidance of Sokaku Takeda Sensei. O-Sensei studied intensively, becoming quite technically proficient; however, his spiritual unrest mounted as his awareness of the futility of a path based on victory over others came to light. Transformed by his spiritual insights, O-Sensei’s technical mastery evolved into a martial art of refinement and astonishing power, fundamentally different from those that preceded it. His heightened spiritual quest for harmony and peace rather than defeat led him to develop the martial art of Aikido.

>"The secret of Aikido is to harmonize with the movement of the universe and bring our selves into accord with the universe itself."

O-Sensei maintained that budo is a work of love, a path to overcome discord in our selves and bring peace to the world, "to make the heart of the universe one's own heart."

In 1927, O-Sensei moved to Tokyo where he founded his first dojo, the Aikikai Hombu Dojo, which still exists today as the Aikido World Headquarters. On April 26, 1969, O-Sensei passed away, leaving his son, Kisshomaru Ueshiba, to become Aikido Doshu ("Aikido Headmaster") of the Aikikai World Headquarters. Kisshomaru Ueshiba Doshu was in turn succeeded by his son and O-Sensei’s grandson, Moriteru Ueshiba Doshu in January 1999, who to this day continues to spread the art of Aikido throughout the world."

#Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu

###Summary

A martial art taht focues primarily on grappling and ground fighting. BJJ promotes the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger, assaliant by using proper technique, leverage, and most notably, taking the fight to the ground, and then applying joint-locks and chokeholds to defeat the other person

###History

According to the United States Jiu-Jitsu Association, "In the last days of the 19th century, some Jiu-Jitsu masters emigrated from Japan to other continents, teaching the martial arts as well as taking part in fights and competitions. Esai Maeda Koma, also known as "Conde Koma," was one such master. After traveling with a troupe which fought in various countries in Europe and the Americas, Koma arrived in Brazil in 1915, and settled in Belem do Para the next year, where he met a man named Gastao Gracie. The father of eight children, among them five boys and three girls, Gastao became a Jiu-Jitsu enthusiast and brought his oldest son, Carlos, to learn from the Japanese master.

For a naturally frail fifteen-year old Carlos Gracie, Jiu-Jitsu became a method not simply for fighting, but for personal improvement. At nineteen, he moved to Rio de Janeiro with his family and began teaching and fighting. In his travels, Carlos would teach classes, and also proved the efficiency of the art by beating opponents who were physically stronger. In 1925, he returned to Rio and opened the first school, known as the "Academia Gracie de Jiu-Jitsu."

Since then, Carlos started to share his knowledge with his brothers, adapting and refining the techniques to the naturally weaker characteristics of his family. Carlos also taught them his philosophies of life and his concepts of natural nutrition. Eventually, Carlos became a pioneer in creating a special diet for athletes, "the Gracie diet," which transformed Jiu-Jitsu into a term synonymous with health. Having created an efficient self defense system, Carlos Gracie saw in the art a way to become a man who was more tolerant, respectful, and self-confident. With a goal of proving Jiu-Jitsu’s superiority over other martial arts, Carlos challenged the greatest fighters of his time. He also managed the fighting careers of his brothers. Because they were fighting and defeating opponents fifty or sixty pounds heavier, the Gracies quickly gained recognition and prestige.

Attracted to the new market which was opened around Jiu-Jitsu, many Japanese practitioners came to Rio, but none were able to establish schools as successful as the Gracies. This was due to the fact that the Japanese stylists were more focused on takedowns and throws, and the Jiu-Jitsu the Gracies practiced had more sophisticated ground fighting and submission techniques. Carlos and his brothers changed and adapted the techniques in such a way that it completely altered the complexion of the international Jiu-Jitsu principles. These techniques were so distinctive to Carlos and his brothers that the sport became attached to a national identity, and is now commonly known as "Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu," practiced by martial artists all over the world, including Japan."

#Capoeira

##Overview

Capoeira is a Brazilian martial arts style that focuses on kicks, knee strikes, punches and evading attacks. It is a very fluid and acrobatic martial arts style. Capoeira looks almost like dancing because Brazilian slaves were able to practice this martial arts in front of their colonial masters by saying that they were dancing. Capoeira students are constantly moving in order to avoid attack or to set themselves up to launch an attack.

###History

According to ABADA-Capoeira New York, "Capoeira is a martial art developed in Brazil by enslaved Africans. The true history of the art is unclear, but most people believe the following: In the 1500′s many Africans were taken from different areas of West Africa and brought to Brazil to be used as slaves by the Portuguese. They were taken from their land, but their culture and desire for freedom could not be taken away. With this need for freedom growing, these people began developing techniques for defending themselves and for escape.

Of course slaves could not be allowed to practice martial arts, so the development and practice of the art had to be disguised. The natural disguise for the art was as a dance since in Africa dance and music are the most popular forms of expression. So these “slaves” developed a way of practicing different defensive and offensive techniques with music, singing, and dance.

Although it appeared to be a harmless dance, the dancers or “Capoeiristas” were practicing deadly fighting techniques. That need to be disguised, and the trickery are part of what separates Capoeira from other martial arts. A lot of the kicks and some movements done in Capoeira can be seen in other arts, but the difference is the delivery. There are many fakes and deceiving movements in Capoeira. Although a certain movement is done with grace and style, it can be very dangerous."

#Jeet-kune-do

###Summary
Jeet Kune Do is a martial arts style that was created by Bruce Lee, the well-known martial artist and movie star. Jeet Kune Do focuses on techniques that are effective in real combat situations (versus martial arts that utilize stylized patterns or that focus on sports "sparring" techniques). This martial arts style focuses on kicks, punches, grappling and traps.

##History

Jeet Kune Do means the 'Way of the Intercepting Fist' and the core philosophical tenet behind JKD translate to...

>'Using no way as way, having no limitation as limitation'.

The term Jeet Kune Do was coined around 1967 by Bruce Lee in an attempt to put a name to his expression of his martial way. Lee wrestled with putting a name to his art as he constantly veered away from any type of crystallization of its essence, however, the simple need to refer to it in some concrete way won out and Jeet Kune Do was born. The idea of intercepting is key to JKD, whether it be the interception of your opponent's technique or intent."

Bruce Lee created Jeet Kune Do by combining elements from many different martial arts including Wing Chun, boxing and even fencing (for its footwork and tactics). According to the Bruce Lee Foundation, "Jeet Kune Do’s stance, footwork, and major strategic points come from fencing. A key principle in fencing, the stop-hit, is essentially the JKD namesake—the way of the intercepting fist. The idea that you can set up your opponent so that you will be able to intercept him in his most vulnerable state—on the attack—is central to the work of fencing authors Aldo Nadi and Julio Martinez Castello, both of whom are quoted heavily in Bruce Lee’s Tao of Jeet Kune Do."

#Judo

##Summary

Judo is a Japanese martial arts style focused on grappling, joint locks and throws. Punches and kicks are generally not practiced during Judo.

##History

Judo was created in Japan in the 1880s and grew out of the even older Japanese martial arts of Jujutsu.

According to the International Judo Federation, the history of Judo "is the history of the shift from a martial art to a modern sport. It tells first how a man, Jigoro Kano, devoted himself to the education of the youth of his country, blending traditions and modernity, using individual prowess for collective benefits.

#Muay-Thai

##History

Muay Thai is a martial arts style from Thailand that is similar to kickboxing but also involves elbow and knee strikes. Muay Thai is also known for its powerful kicking techniques.

Many mixed martial arts fighters employ Muay Thai techniques given the effectiveness of this style's strikes. A number of MMA training routines combine Muay Thai techniques (i.e. elbow strikes and knee strikes) with the grappling techniques of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. The most well-known MMA fighter with a Muay Thai background is Anderson Silva.

##Summary

According to the Thai Boxing Association of the USA, "Muay Thai started way back in the medieval ages when wars were fought with bows and arrows, swords, and pikes. And in hand-to-hand combat arms, legs, knees, and elbows were also used as weapons. This sport which was included in military training was made famous by King Nareusan 1560 A.D. During one of the many battles between Burma and Siam he was captured. The Burmese knew of his prowess as the best unarmed fighter in the realm and gave him a chance to fight with their best for his freedom. Upon his return to Siam he was hailed as a hero and Siamese-style boxing, as it was called then, was soon recognized as a national sport. Boxing in this style reached its zenith of popularity about two hundred years ago, i.e., in the reign of Prachao Sua (King Tiger), when it was indulged in by all classes of the population.

From those days up until the early part of this century, the fighters, particularly those in provinces, used horsehide strips and later help in lieu of gloves. It was also a practice at one time to grind pieces of glass into the help if both contestants agreed. Since these practices were obviously dangerous to the fighters' health, regular boxing gloves were introduced about 50 years ago and have been used ever since.
