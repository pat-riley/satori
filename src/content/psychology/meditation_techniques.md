#Meditation Techniques

##Vispassana Mediation
>Looking into something with clarity and precision, seeing each component as distinct and separate, and piercing all the way through so as to perceive the most fundamental reality of that thing - Henepola Gunaratana

   * Southern Buddhist tradition
   * Focus is on breath
   * Anapanna - (concentration on breath)

###Practice

1. Sit comfortable, body straight and your head, neck, and chest aligned and take 2 or 3 intentional slow deep breaths and close your eyes
2. Focus on your breath going in and your breath coming out. 
    * Focusing on the muscle in the solar plexus, which every time you breathe moves in one direction and every time you breathe out, moves is another direction - rising, falling, rising, falling.
3. Focusing on the inside of your nostrils at the tip of your nose - as the air goes by, you will feel a slight whisper of air on the in and sleigh whisper of air on the out
4. Stick with this for 15 minutes

###Tips
* Your goal is to focus primarily on the breath in the gentlest way possible.
* Let thoughts go - and always come back to being your breath
* The art is not to get violent with your thoughts. Don't try to push them away, don't feel guilty because yo are feeling them.
* You are the gatekeeper, watching the gate open and close.
* Count to 10, if your mind wanders off bring it back with awareness.
