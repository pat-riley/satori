#Universal Design Elements

##80/20 Rule

*A high percentage of effects in a any large system are cause by a low percentage of variables*

Also known as...
- Pareto’s Principle
- Juran’s Prunciple
- Vital Few and Trivial Many


Originated by Vilfredo Pareto, an italian economist who notices that 20 percent of the Italian people possessed 80 percent of the wealth


### Use in design
- focusing resources and realizing greater efficiency in design
- When redesigning systems to make them more efficient, focusing on aspects of the system beyond the critical 20 percent yields diminishing results, Designers should focus on the 20% of the highly used features

### Examples
- 80% of a products usage involves 20% of it’s features
- The 20% of most commonly used features are located in the easy to access toolbar


### Approaches to take
1. Make a list of all the features
2. Find the 20% that are most commonly used
3. Design the system to make those features more efficient

## Accessibility

*Objects and environments should be designed to be usable without modification, by as many people as possible.*


Also known as…
- barrier-free-design
- universal design


Four characteristics of accessible design
1. Perceptibility
2. Operability
3. Simplicity
4. Forgiveness


### Perceptibility
Achieved when everyone can use the design, regardless of sensory abilities.
- present information using redundant coding methods (textual, iconic, tactile)
- compatibility with assistive sensory technologies (alt tags)     
- position controls and information so that seated and standing can perceive     

###Operability
Achieved when everyone can use the design, regardless of physical abilities.

 - minimize repetitive actions and need for sustained physical effort
- facilitate use of controls through good affordances and constraints
- provide compatibility with assistive physical technologies

###Simplicity
Everyone can easily understand and use the design, regardless of experience, literacy, or concentration level

- remove unnecessary complexity
- clearly and consistently code and label controls
- progressive disclosure to present only relevant information and controls
- provide clear prompting and feedback for all actions
- reading levels accommodate a wide range of literacy


###Forgiveness
Designs minimize the occurrence and consequence of errors.
- good affordances and constraints (controls can only be used in correct ways)
- use confirmations and warnings to reduce occurrence of errors
- include reversible actions and safey nets to minimize the consequences of errors




##Advance Organizer

An instructional technique that helps people understand new information in terms of what they already know.


Definition: Brief chunks of information - spoken, written, or illustrated - presented prior to new material to help facilitate learning and understanding 

Distinct from overviews and summaries in that they are presented on a more abstract level than the rest of the information - they present the “big picture” prior to the details.


Two types of advances organizers
1. Expository
2. Comparative


#### Expository
- useful when audiences have little or no knowledges similar to the information being taught
- ex: teaching an audience who has no ideas about forklifts the general concept of a forklift first
Comparative
- useful when audiences have existing knowledge similar to the information being presented
- ex: teaching an audience of forklift drivers the differences between old forklifts


## Development Cycle

Requirements, Design, Development, Testing

Requirements
- market research, customer feedback, focus groups, usability testing
- controlled interactions between designers and members of the target audience
- don’t ask people what they want, because they don’t know


#### Design
- design requirements are translated into a form that yields a set of specifications
- careful research of existing analogous solutions

#### Development
- design specifications are transformed into an actual product
- goal is to accurately represent the design specifications

#### Testing
- product is tested to ensure that it meets design requirements
- must be accepted by target audience.
