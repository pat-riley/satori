# Penrose Tiling

Non-periodic tiling generated by an aperiodic set of prototiles.

Named after mathematician and physicist Roger Penrose who investigated these sets in the 1970s. 

A Penrose titling has many remarkable properties, most notably;

* It is non-periodic, which means that it lacks any translational symmetry
* It is self-similar, so that the same patterns occur at larger and larger scales.Thus, the tiling can be obtained through “inflation” and any finite patch from the tiling occurs infinitely many times.
* It is a quasicrystal; implemented as a physical structure a Penrose tiling will produce Bragg diffraction and its diffraction reveals both the fivefold symmetry and the underlying long range order.

Various methods to construct Penrose tiling have been discovered, including matching rules, substitution tiling or subdivision rule.
