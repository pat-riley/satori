## Rotational Symmetry

Generally speaking, an object with rotational symmetry also known in biological contexts as radial symmetry, is an object that looks the same after a certain amount of rotation. An object may have more than one rotational symmetry; for instance, if reflections or turning it over are not counted. The degree of rotational symmetry is how many degrees the shapes has to be turned to look the same on a different side or vertex. It can not be the same side or vertex.

## Translational Symmetry


In geometry, a translation slides a thing. 

## Reflection

## Glide Reflection 

Translation + reflection
