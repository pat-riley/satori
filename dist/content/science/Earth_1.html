<h2 id="energy">Energy</h2>
<p>First we must be comfortable with the three forms of energy.</p>
<ul>
<li>kinetic energy - energy of motion, speed</li>
<li>potential energy - energy of position</li>
<li>thermal energy - thermal motion of atoms of molecules</li>
</ul>
<p>Kinetic energy and potential energy together often are referred to as <strong>mechanical energy</strong>.  </p>
<p>Throwing a ball in the air puts an object in motion (kinetic energy). When it reaches the top the kinetic energy is converted into potential energy. Together, this <strong>mechanical energy</strong> is said to be conserved.</p>
<p>On earth with the presence of air, the friction between the air and the ball convert the mechanical energy to thermal energy. </p>
<h2 id="electromagnetic-radiation">Electromagnetic Radiation</h2>
<p>All bodies (pieces or regions of matter, in the physicists parlance) at temperature above absolute zero radiate energy in the form of <strong>electromagnetic waves</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="electromagnetic.png" alt="EM-Field"></p>
<h4 id="wien-s-law">Wienâ€™s Law</h4>
<p>The product of the absolute temperature and the wavelength of the most intense radiation is a constant. </p>
<p>This means that a body with a relatively high surface temperature, like the sun, radiates energy at relatively short wavelengths, and a body like a relatively low surface temperature, like the earth, radiates energy at relatively long wavelengths.</p>
