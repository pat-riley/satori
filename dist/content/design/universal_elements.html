<h2 id="80-20-rule">80/20 Rule</h2>
<p><em>A high percentage of effects in a any large system are cause by a low percentage of variables</em></p>
<p>Also known as...</p>
<ul>
<li>Pareto’s Principle</li>
<li>Juran’s Prunciple</li>
<li>Vital Few and Trivial Many</li>
</ul>
<p>Originated by Vilfredo Pareto, an italian economist who notices that 20 percent of the Italian people possessed 80 percent of the wealth</p>
<h3 id="use-in-design">Use in design</h3>
<ul>
<li>focusing resources and realizing greater efficiency in design</li>
<li>When redesigning systems to make them more efficient, focusing on aspects of the system beyond the critical 20 percent yields diminishing results, Designers should focus on the 20% of the highly used features</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>80% of a products usage involves 20% of it’s features</li>
<li>The 20% of most commonly used features are located in the easy to access toolbar</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="approaches-to-take">Approaches to take</h3>
<ol>
<li>Make a list of all the features</li>
<li>Find the 20% that are most commonly used</li>
<li>Design the system to make those features more efficient</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
<p><em>Objects and environments should be designed to be usable without modification, by as many people as possible.</em></p>
<p>Also known as…</p>
<ul>
<li>barrier-free-design</li>
<li>universal design</li>
</ul>
<p>Four characteristics of accessible design</p>
<ol>
<li>Perceptibility</li>
<li>Operability</li>
<li>Simplicity</li>
<li>Forgiveness</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="perceptibility">Perceptibility</h3>
<p>Achieved when everyone can use the design, regardless of sensory abilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>present information using redundant coding methods (textual, iconic, tactile)</li>
<li>compatibility with assistive sensory technologies (alt tags)     </li>
<li>position controls and information so that seated and standing can perceive     </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="operability">Operability</h3>
<p>Achieved when everyone can use the design, regardless of physical abilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>minimize repetitive actions and need for sustained physical effort<ul>
<li>facilitate use of controls through good affordances and constraints</li>
<li>provide compatibility with assistive physical technologies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>
<p>Everyone can easily understand and use the design, regardless of experience, literacy, or concentration level</p>
<ul>
<li>remove unnecessary complexity</li>
<li>clearly and consistently code and label controls</li>
<li>progressive disclosure to present only relevant information and controls</li>
<li>provide clear prompting and feedback for all actions</li>
<li>reading levels accommodate a wide range of literacy</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="forgiveness">Forgiveness</h3>
<p>Designs minimize the occurrence and consequence of errors.</p>
<ul>
<li>good affordances and constraints (controls can only be used in correct ways)</li>
<li>use confirmations and warnings to reduce occurrence of errors</li>
<li>include reversible actions and safey nets to minimize the consequences of errors</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="advance-organizer">Advance Organizer</h2>
<p>An instructional technique that helps people understand new information in terms of what they already know.</p>
<p>Definition: Brief chunks of information - spoken, written, or illustrated - presented prior to new material to help facilitate learning and understanding </p>
<p>Distinct from overviews and summaries in that they are presented on a more abstract level than the rest of the information - they present the “big picture” prior to the details.</p>
<p>Two types of advances organizers</p>
<ol>
<li>Expository</li>
<li>Comparative</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="expository">Expository</h4>
<ul>
<li>useful when audiences have little or no knowledges similar to the information being taught</li>
<li>ex: teaching an audience who has no ideas about forklifts the general concept of a forklift first
Comparative</li>
<li>useful when audiences have existing knowledge similar to the information being presented</li>
<li>ex: teaching an audience of forklift drivers the differences between old forklifts</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="development-cycle">Development Cycle</h2>
<p>Requirements, Design, Development, Testing</p>
<p>Requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>market research, customer feedback, focus groups, usability testing</li>
<li>controlled interactions between designers and members of the target audience</li>
<li>don’t ask people what they want, because they don’t know</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="design">Design</h4>
<ul>
<li>design requirements are translated into a form that yields a set of specifications</li>
<li>careful research of existing analogous solutions</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="development">Development</h4>
<ul>
<li>design specifications are transformed into an actual product</li>
<li>goal is to accurately represent the design specifications</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="testing">Testing</h4>
<ul>
<li>product is tested to ensure that it meets design requirements</li>
<li>must be accepted by target audience.</li>
