<h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2>
<p>“Generative Design is not about designing the building – it’s about designing the system that builds a building” – Laws Hesellgren</p>
<p>“Generative Design approach works in imitation of Nature, performing ideas as codes, able to generate endless variations.” – Celestin Soddu</p>
<p>“Generative Design processes is about the modeling of initial condition of an object (its genetics) instead of modeling the final form” – Paola Fontana</p>
<p>“A way of translating computational energy into creative energy”</p>
<p>“Generative Design is the transformation of computational energy into creative exploration energy, empowering human designers to explore greater number of design possibilities within modifiable constrains”</p>
<p>“ Generative Art refers to any practice where the artist uses a system such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing or resulting in a completed work of art.” – Phillip Galanter</p>
<p>“Problems can never be solved at the level they were created” - Einstein</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Human beings have always been tool-makers. It is how we separated off from autonomous agents in nature and began to shape the environment around us. It must have started with a rock, stick, or branch. Something that we just picked up of the ground and after thousands of years we learned how to turn that into tools that would allow us to make marks on cut down trees in order to communicate with other tool - makers when we were not directly in front of them. </p>
<p>We have come a long way. We used the rock to make fire, and we used that fire to make steel. Steel opened up a myriad of possibilities for us that we could never possibly imagine. And so on down the line until we made one of the electronic devices that you are probably holding in your hands right now. Do not be blown away by its magical shine - It is merely a carefully assembled piece of earth. The best part about it is that it allows you to make contact with other human beings - like we have always wanted.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that we used tools to make the future iterations of products, and then we use those products to make future generations of tools. This is how technologically evolves. It has got us this far and it is going to take us farther than we can imagine in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>But do we apply this type of thinking in our day to day lives? Like our ancestors using rocks to make shields do we constantly use our primitive thought processes to hatch higher levels?</p>
<p>This may seem like common sense but I believe we all too often fall back into the traditional ways or ways that are easier in order to solve our problems and create new iterations. It comes down to the points - we are often ether too lazy or too afraid. Most of the time all of our problems can be boiled down into those two categories.</p>
<p>But we are evolved! We can do so much better than that. Let us use the knowledge that we have. We should not be falling back onto tradition and what has worked in the past - we should be pushing the boundaries of our own inherent functionality. Questioning not only what we should build, but the thought process which let us to the conclusion to build in the first place</p>
<p>In programming languages - We have created higher level languages that read much like common english. We speak to the commuter in almsot human terms in order for us to write programs at a much higher rate of speed and efficiency. After we are done we send it into a complier and it is translated into the machine code of ones and zeros that make our ideas come into fruition. </p>
<p>I propose that we take that kind of thinking - the ability to abstract problem solving into genetical information for ideas and improve not only our own designs, but the process that led us to that design in the first place..</p>
<h2 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h2>
<p>Dynamic - constant state flux, activity, or progress</p>
<p>Responsive - Reactive to a design rule and user needs or promoting</p>
<p>Novel - Offers opportunities to present fresh outcomes through iteration, play, and discovery</p>
<p>Emergent - Produces controlled complexity through the interaction of simple components</p>
<p>Iterative - Able to produce numerous outcomes with cohesive visual properties</p>

<li>Does not have a clear definition</li>
<li>More of an approach </li>
<li>Higher level thinking</li>
<li>Having the ability to replicate for itself

*It can be a solution, or a launching pad to go further</li>

<h2 id="generative-process">Generative Process</h2>
<p>The Generative Design Process can not be seen as truly innovative and different until compared to the traditional design process. It is important to note however, that this new process is not a means to replace traditional methods,, but rather - just another tool in the designers bag. When to use it becomes important and we have discussed this in the previous chapter.</p>

<p>Here are some common concepts that are present throughout nature.</p>
<p>Golden Ratio - A sacred Ratio</p>
<p>L-System - A set of instructions that, when implemented, resembles the patterns found in tree branches
    Variables:    A B
    Constants:    None
    Start:        A
    Rules:        (A &gt; AB) ; (B &gt; A)</p>

<p>Open Frameworks</p>
<p>OSC Basics</p>
<h2 id="programming-concepts">Programming Concepts</h2>
<p>These are some concepts that are central to programming. Computer programming was developed in part to replicate human thought processes so many of these concepts that we will go over here will have parallels in your day to day thoughts process.</p>
<p>Together these concepts illustrated form the framework for how we as human beings and how our computers end up processing as well.</p>
<p>Repitition - doing something over and over again for the sake of<br>    a) Getting better at it (building neural networks) - strength and conditioning
    b) Trying out new experiments (changing variables each time)</p>
<p>Randomness - used to create variations to break up struct regularity of the computer. Human hands in randomness make a bell curve. Different types of random simulated - so that it appears to be random.</p>
<p>Emergence - Simple rules that yield highly complex results, most commonly reffered to as the butterfly effect. Many organic shapes are domed following the result of a simple algorith, that consists of two isntructions.</p>
<p>Simulation - Forced directed layout</p>
<h2 id="tool-building">Tool Building</h2>
<p>One of the most exciting aspects of generative design is the ability to create and use new tools that have never existed before.</p>
<p>These tools can do everything from
    a) Helping with a repetitive task over and over agin
    b) Create results that are inhuman
    c) Create interesting combinations that one would never quite expect to see</p>
<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
<p>I have an inherent belief that all of our solutions, designs, art, and innovation does not truly come from our individual minds. To me, the concept that someone “came up” with a design is outrageous! Now this is not to say that there is not merit within our own human ingenuity, quite the contrary actually, I believe that human beings are able to do wonderful and infinitely complex things. But to say that they came up with these ideas “on our own” is a bold statement.</p>
<p>Now this can get a little spiritual, but I will try and use loose vocabulary so that people of all faiths and philosophy systems can get on board. Whether you are a monotheistic believer or a rational determinist, you should be able to follow my train of thought here.
Let us name an object “The Source.” This can be called God, This can be called your environment, this can be called every rational causality and effect that has unfolded since the beginning of time, it does not matter.</p>
<p>It is the initial condition that flows through all of us.</p>
<p>Which leads us to the next part of the equation. Us. Again, it does not matter what you believe. It would be hard to find someone who would deny the existence of their own thoughts, and so it is unanimous that there is in a sense an I in all of us.</p>
<p>So we have to pieces to the puzzle as of now. Everything that was before (The source) and our present thoughts that are on the cusp of the present moment that we can create the future. The future can be described as this.</p>
<pre><code><span class="title">The</span> source + I = the future</code></pre>
<p>Everything that was and is, added to our thoughts and decisions, is equal to what we create every second of every day.  Now this might have gone a little too far down the rabbit hole for some, but it illustrated a philosophical and logical explanation for anyone that believes that </p>
