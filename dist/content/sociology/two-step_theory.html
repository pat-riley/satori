<p>The two step flow of communication model says that most people form their opinions under the influence of opinion leaders, who are in turn influences by the mass media. So according to this model, ideas flow from mass media to opinion leaders, and from them to a wider population.</p>
<div class="wonderful">Test</div>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The two-step flow of communication hypothesis was first introduced by Paul Lazarsfeld,
Bernard Berelson, and Hazel Gaudet in The People&#39;s Choice, a 1944 study focused on the
process of decision-making during a Presidential election campaign. These researchers
expected to find empirical support for the direct influence of media messages on voting
intentions. They were surprised to discover, however, that informal, personal contacts were
mentioned far more frequently than exposure to radio or newspaper as sources of influence
on voting behavior. Armed with this data, Katz and Lazarsfeld developed the two-step flow theory of mass communication.</p>
<h2 id="core-assumptions-and-statements">Core Assumptions and Statements</h2>
<p>This theory asserts that information from the media moves in two distinct stages.</p>
<p><img src="two-step-communication.png" alt="two-step-diagram"></p>
<p>Individuals (opinion leaders) who pay close attention to the mass media and its messages
receive the information. Opinion leaders pass on their own interpretations in addition to the
actual media content. The term ‘personal influence’ was coined to refer to the process
intervening between the media’s direct message and the audience’s ultimate reaction to that
message. Opinion leaders are quite influential in getting people to change their attitudes
and behaviors and are quite similar to those they influence.</p>
<p>The two-step flow theory has improved our understanding of how the mass media influence decision making. The theory refined the ability to predict the influence of media messages on audience behavior, and it
helped explain why certain media campaigns may have failed to alter audience attitudes an
behavior. The two-step flow theory gave way to the multi-step flow theory if mass commuication of diffusion of innovation theory.</p>
<h2 id="the-opinion-leaders">The opinion leaders</h2>
<p>A study by Robert Merton revealed that opinion leadership is not a general characteristic of a
person, but rather limited to specific issues. Individuals who act as opinion leaders on one issue,
may not be considered influentials in regard to other issues (Merton, 1949). A later study directed
by Lazarsfeld and Katz further investigated the characteristics of opinion leaders. This study
confirmed the earlier assertions that personal influence seems more important in decision making
than media. Again, influential individuals seem constrained in their opinion leading to particular
topics, non-overlapping among the individuals. The opinion leaders seem evenly distributedamong the social, economical, and educational levels within their community, but very similar in
these areas to those with whom they had influence.</p>
<p>Katz and Lazarsfeld did not identify any particular traits amongst opinion leaders that stand out.
The traits that characterize each of the opinion leaders in their niche did have things in common,
though. For one thing, the opinion leaders were identified as having the strongest interest in their
particular niche. They hold positions within their community affording them special competence
in their particular niches. They are generally gregarious, sociable individuals. Finally, they
had/have contact with relevant information supplied from outside their immediate circle.
Interestingly enough, Katz and Lazarsfeld observed that the opinion leaders receive a
disproportionate amount of their external information from media appropriate to their niche.
Studies by Glock and Nicosia determined that opinion leaders act &quot;as a source of social pressure
toward a particular choice and as a source of social support to reinforce that choice once it has
been made (1966).&quot; Charles Glock explained that opinion leaders often develop leadership
positions in their social circles. They achieve these positions based on their knowledge of
situations outside their circles (1952)</p>
<h2 id="personal-contact-yeilds-more-trust">Personal Contact yeilds more trust</h2>
<p>The opinion leaders do not replace media, but rather guide the discussion of media and information flow. The opnion leader should not be regarded as replacing the role of interpoersinal networks, but as reemphasizing hte role of the group and interpersonal contacts.</p>
<h5 id="five-charactertics-of-personal-contact">Five charactertics of personal contact</h5>
<ol>
<li>Non-purposiveness/casualness - In conversation opinions can just &quot;pop up&quot; and they are. People are less likely to have their defenses up because in preperation and are more likely to be open to the conversation</li>
<li>Flexibility to counter resistance - In conversation, there is always oppurtinuty to counter any resistance. This is not so in media, a one sided form of communication.</li>
<li>Trust - Personal contact carries more trust than media. As people interact, they are better able through observation of body language and vocal cues to judge the honesty of a person in discussion.</li>
<li>Persuasion without conviction - The formal media is forced to persuade of change opiniions. In personal communication, somtimes friendly insistence can cause action without affecting any comprehension of the issues.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>
<p>Although the theory of indirect flow of information from media to the target was quickly
adopted, the original study performed by Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet was not. It had a few
faults. The panel method by which they attempted to better understand the influences reaching a
voter was unfaulted. It very effectively allowed the researchers to notice changes in a voter&#39;s
feelings almost immediately. The resulting unit of change was an objective measurement that
could easily be recorded and compared. The faults lie in the manner with which the researchers
addressed the flow of influences.</p>
<p>Since the research was not designed to specifically test the flow of influence, the experiment was
decidedly lacking in explanations. The first problem concerning the findings of the study were
that the data had to be collected in a random sample, but subjects in a random sample can only
speak for themselves. For these reasons, each person could only say whether or not they
considered his/herself an advice giver. Lazarsfeld and his associates in the 1940 election study
were unable to determine the specific flow of influence. They determined there were a number of
opinion leaders spread throughout the socio-economic groups; however, these leaders were not
directly linked to particular groups within the socio-economic levels.</p>
<p>Even within studies specifically designed to determine who opinion leaders are and how they are
different from the average populace, there have been problems born from experimental design.
&quot;The criticisms of the concept of opinion leaders has focused mainly on its methodological
deficiencies (Weimann, 1991).&quot; As Weimann suggested in his 1989 study of pervious research,
much of the design problems involved determining the opinion leaders while studying the flow
of information. There seemed to be too many factors to control. Despite the difficulties in
qualifying the influentials, the theory of a group of individuals that filter the flow of media
information has lived on.</p>
