<p>The <em>internet Protocol</em> (IP) is a network layer protocol.</p>
<h2 id="vocabulary">Vocabulary</h2>

<h2 id="http">HTTP</h2>
<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.</p>
<p>HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.</p>
<p>A web browser may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a web site may be the server.</p>
<p>Example: A client (browser) submits an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client. The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content.</p>
<h3 id="http-status-code">HTTP status code</h3>
<p>Below is a listing of the HTTP status codes. These codes enable a client accessing another computer or device over HTTP to know how to proceed or not proceed.</p>
