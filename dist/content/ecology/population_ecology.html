<p>Thomas Malthus exponential law of population Growth</p>
<p><img src="malthus.png" alt="malthus"></p>
<p>&quot;At its most elementary level, interspecific competition involves two species utilizing a similar resource. It rapidly gets more complicated, but stripping the phenomenon of all its complications, this is the basic principle: two consumers consuming the same resource.&quot;</p>
<p>It is an approximate physical law that it is generally acknowledged that nothing can grow at a constant rate indefinitely.
Accurate for short term predictions but not suitable for predictions 10 to 20 years from now.
Compared to and has &quot;certain limited resemblance&quot; to the laws of Newtonian mechanics.</p>
<h3 id="rule-of-70">Rule of 70</h3>
<p>Roughly explains the time periods involved in exponential growth at a constant rate.</p>
<h5 id="example">EXAMPLE</h5>
<p>If growth is measured annually then a 1% growth rate results in a doubling every 70 years.
The number 70 comes from the observation that the natural log of 2 is about 0.7</p>
<h2 id="common-terms">Common Terms</h2>
<p>Species Population  - All individuals of a species</p>
<p>Metapopulation - A set of spatially disjunct population, among which there is some immigration</p>
<p>Population - A group of conspecific individuals that is demographically, genetically, or spatially disjunct from other groups of individuals</p>
<p>Aggregation - A spatially clustered group of individuals</p>
<p>Deme - A group of individuals more genetically similar to each other than to other individuals, usually with some degree of spatial isolation as well.</p>
<p>Local Population - A group of individuals within an investigator-delimited area smaller than the geographic range of the species and often within a population (as defined above) A local population could be a disjoint population as well.</p>
<p>Subpopulation - An arbitrary spatially delimited subset of individuals from within a population.</p>
