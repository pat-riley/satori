<p>This book aims to give in brief space the principal requirements of plain English style. It only concentrates on a few essential rules. The goal is to improve ones compositional skills and eliminate common violations.</p>
<h2 id="elementary-rules-of-usage">Elementary Rules of Usage</h2>
<h4 id="form-the-posessive-singular-of-nouns-by-adding-s-">Form the posessive singular of nouns by adding &#39;s&#39;</h4>
<p>Follow this rule whatever the final cononant. Thus write,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Charle&#39;s friend</p>
<p>Burn&#39;s poem</p>
<p>the witch&#39;s malice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are a righteous fellow, Exepctions are the possessive of ancient proper names.</p>
<h4 id="in-a-series-of-three-or-more-terms-with-a-single-conjunction-use-a-comma-after-each-term-except-the-last-">In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last.</h4>
<p>Thus write, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>red, white, and blue</p>
<p>gold, silver, or copper</p>
<p>He opened the letter, read it, and made a note</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="enclose-parenthetic-expressions-between-commas">Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel on foot`</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rule is difficult to apply; it is frequently hard to decide whether a single word, such as <em>however</em>, or a brief phrase, is or is not parentheric. If the interruption to the flow of the sentance is but slight, the writer may saftely omit the commas. But whether the interruption be slight or considerable, he must never insert one comma and ommit the other.</p>
<p>The following examples are not acceptable</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mary&#39;s husban, Colonel Nelson paid us a visit yesturday</p>
<p>My brother you will be pleased to hear, is now in perfect health</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following should <strong>always</strong> be regarded as parenthetic</p>
<ol>
<li>the year, when forming part of a date, and the day of the monthm when following the day of the week</li>
<li>the abbreviations etc. and jr.</li>
<li>non-restrictive relative clauses, that is, those which do not serve to identify or define the antecendent noun , and similiar clauses introduced by conjunctions indicating time or place</li>
</ol>
<p>To illustrate the third rule above, concider the following example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The audience, which had at first been indifferent, became more and more interested.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="place-a-comma-before-a-conjunction-introducing-a-co-ordinate-clause-">Place a comma before a conjunction introducing a co-ordinate clause.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The early records of the city have disappeared, and the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sentances of this type, isolated from their context, could benefit from a rewrite. They make complete sense when the comma is reached but the rest of the sentence comes across as an afterthought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the early records of the city have disappeared, the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed.</p>
</blockquote>
