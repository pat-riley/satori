<p>In going through this PDF I will try and turn every paragraph into a sentence. </p>
<h2 id="private-law">Private Law</h2>
<p>The common belief has been that a  legal system must require state provision. However this argument focuses on the necessity of law itself and not the ability of another party to manage laws. In this essay, Robert Murphy plans to argue that the elimination of the State will not lead to lawless chaos. Voluntary institutions will merge to effectively and peacefully resolve the disputes arising in everyday life.</p>
<p>The right often calls for Peace by means of war, and the left is seen to call for Peace by means of slavery (taxation). It is time to abandon these paradoxes. It took no king to produce language, money, or science, and it takes no government to produce a just legal system. </p>
<h3 id="contract">Contract</h3>
<p>It is an Appeal to Tradition, a logical fallacy, to assume that there must be a governing body to reside over law just because it has always been that way. The same logic goes for having a overarching “Law of the Land” set of laws that binds everyone. We already live in a world where different sets of laws coexist every time we cross a border, or enter a private school.</p>
<p>Personal contracts would replace the legislated body of laws. </p>
<h4 id="example-">Example:</h4>
<p>An employer that would want to prevent his employees from stealing from him would make them all sign a contract.</p>
<p>“ I promise not to steal from Acme Firm and if I get caught stealing as established by Arbitration Agency X, then I agree to pay whatever restitution that Agency X deems approrpiate. “</p>
<p>There are to things we immediately see in this contract.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is completely voluntary </li>
<li>The existence of Arbitration Agency X ensures fairness and objectivity in any disputes</li>
</ol>
<p>To attempt to poke holes in this system let us consider what would happen when human nature and corruption enters the picture. </p>
<p>Acme Firm decides to bribe the Arbitration agency so that they support false claims that a set of employees stole from them. Thus they would get paid, despite the fact that the employees didn’t actually steal. But just because an arbitration agency ruled a certain way, wouldn’t make everyone agree with it, just as people complain about outrageous court rulings by government judges. The press would pick up on the unfair rulings and in this current age of transparency and interconnectedness, people would lose faith in the objectivity of Agency X’s decisions. Potential employees would think twice before working for the big firm, and the Arbitration Agencies reputation would be tattered as well. Other firms would patronize different, more reputable systems and workers would flock to them. </p>
<h4 id="expertise">Expertise</h4>
<p>Under this system, legs experts would draft the “law of the land” and not corrupt and inept politicians.</p>
