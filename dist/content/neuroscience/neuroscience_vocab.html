<p><em>This list is in no particular order whatsoever</em></p>
<p><strong>Neurons</strong> - receive information and transmit it to other cells.</p>
<p><strong>Membrane</strong> - a structure that separates the inside of the cell from the outside enviroment </p>
<p><strong>Nucleus</strong>  - the structure that contains the chromosomes</p>
<p><strong>Mitochondirion</strong> - structure that performs metabolic activities, providing energy for the other cells</p>
<p><strong>Ribosomes</strong> - the sites at which the cells synthesizes new protein molecules</p>
<p><strong>Endoplasmic reticulum</strong> - network of thin tubes that transport newly synthesized proteins to other locations</p>
<p><strong>Motor Neuron</strong> - has soma in the spinal chord, it receives excitation from other neurons through its dendrites and conducts impulses along its axon to the muscle.</p>
<p><strong>Sensory Neuron</strong> - specialized at one end to be highly sensitive to a particular type of stimulation, such as sight, sound or touch</p>
<p><strong>Dendrites</strong> - branching fibers that get narrower near their ends, their surface is lined with synaptic receptors at which the dendrites receives information from other neurons. The greater the surface area the more information it can receive.</p>
<p><strong>Dendritic Spines</strong> - the short outgrowths that increase the surface area available for synapses. </p>
<p><strong>Soma</strong> (cell body) - Greek for body, contains the nucleus, ribosomes, and mitochondria. Most of the metabolic work of the neuron occurs here. Cell bodies are covered with synapses on its surface in many neurons.</p>
<p><strong>Axon</strong> - comes from greek &quot;axis&quot; - thin fiber of constant diameter, in most cases longer than the dendrites. </p>
<p><strong>Myelin Sheath</strong> - insulating material that surrounds the axons
Nodes of Ranvier - nodes of interruptions along the axon</p>
<p><strong>Presynaptic Terminal</strong> - the point from which the axon releases chemicals that cross through the junction between one neuron and the next.</p>
<p><strong>Afferent axon</strong> - brings in information into a structure</p>
<p><strong>Efferent axon</strong> - carries information away from a structure</p>
<ul>
<li>Every sensory neuron is an afferent to the rest of the nervous system</li>
<li>Every motor neuron is an efferent from the nervous system </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Blood-Brain barrier</strong> - the mechanism that excludes most chemicals from the vertebrate brain</p>
<p><strong>Active transport</strong> - protein-mediated process that expends energy to pump chemicals from the blood into the brain</p>
<p><strong>Glucose</strong> - a sugar that vertebrate neurons depend almost entirely on</p>
<p><strong>Electrical Gradient</strong> (polarization) - a difference in electrical charge between the inside and outside of a cell. The neuron inside the membrane has a slightly negative electrical potential with respect to the outside, mainly because of negatively charged proteins inside the cell.</p>
<p><strong>Resting Potential</strong>  - the different in voltage in a resting neuron. </p>
<p><strong>Selevtively permeable</strong> - some chemicals pass through membranes that are selectively permeable than others.</p>
<p><strong>Sodium-Potassium Pump</strong> - a protein complex repeatedly transports three sodium ions out of the cell while drawing two potassium ins into it. It is an active transport that requires energy.</p>
<p><strong>Concentration Gradient</strong> - the difference in distribution of ions across the membrane. </p>
<p><strong>Action Potentials</strong> - the process of messages being sent down by axons</p>
<p><strong>hyperpolarization</strong> - when an axon&#39;s membrane is at rest, the recording show a negative potential inside the axon. If we now use another electrode to apply a negative charge we can further increase the negative charge inside the neuron. This is hyper polarization. </p>
<p><strong>Volt-Gated Channels</strong> - channels that  regulate sodium and potassium intake, the permeability depends on the voltage difference across the membrane. </p>
<p><strong>Local Anesthetic</strong> - since action potentials require the flow of sodium and potassium, anesthetics attach to the sodium channels of the membrane, preventing sodium ions from entering and thereby stopping action potentials. When a dentist administers Novocain before drilling into one of your teeth, your receptors are screaming &quot;pain&quot; but the axons can&#39;t transmit the message to your brain so you don&#39;t feel it.</p>
<p><strong>All-or-none-law</strong> - the amplitude and velocity of an action potential are independent of the intensity of the stimulus that initiated it, provided that the stimulus reaches the threshold. Toilet flushing analogy, you have to press a certain amount to trigger the flush but pressing it repeatedly doesn&#39;t change anything.</p>
<p><strong>Refractrory Period</strong> - immediently after an action potential, the cell is in a refractory period during which it resists the production of further action potentials. </p>
<p><strong>Absolute Refractory Period</strong> - the membrane cannot produce an action potential regardless od the stimulation. </p>
<p><strong>Relative refractory period</strong> - a stronger than usual stimulus is necessary to initiate and action potential. The refractory period has two mechanisms, the sodium channels are closed and the potassium is flowing out of the cell at a faster than usual rate.</p>
<p><strong>axon hillock</strong> - a swelling where the axon exits the soma</p>
<p><strong>Propagation of the action potential</strong> - describes the transmission of an action potential down an axon</p>
<p><strong>Myelin</strong> - insulating material composed of fats and proteins.</p>
<p><strong>Myelinated axons</strong> - those axons that are covered with a myelin sheath. </p>
<p><strong>Salatory Conduction</strong> - the jumping of action potentials from node to node</p>
<p><strong>Local Neurons</strong> - neurons that do not have an exon and can only exchange information with their closest neighbors. </p>
<p><strong>Graded Potential</strong> - when a local neuron receives information from other neurons, it has graded potential which varies in magnitude in proportion to intensity of the stimulus. </p>
<p><strong>Snapse</strong> - specialized gap between neurons </p>
<p><strong>reflecxes</strong> - automatic muscular responses to a stimuli</p>
<p><strong>reflex arc</strong> - the circuit from sensory neuron to muscle response</p>
<p><strong>temporal summation</strong> - repeated stimuli within a brief period of time have a cumulative effect. Summation over time. </p>
<p><strong>Spatial Summation </strong>- summations over space, synaptic inputs from separate locations combine their effects on a neuron. </p>
<p><strong>Spontaneous firing rate</strong> - a periodic production of action potentials even without synaptic input.</p>
<p><strong>Amino Acids</strong> - acids containing an amine group (NH2)
<strong>Monoamines</strong> - chemicals formed by a change in certain amino acids
<strong>Acetylcholine</strong> - a chemical similar to an amino acid, exept that it includes an N(CH3) group
<strong>Neuropeptides</strong> - chain of amino acids
<strong>purines</strong> - a category of chemicals inducing adenosine and several of its derivatives
<strong>gases</strong> - nitric oxide and possible others</p>
<p><strong>Vesicles</strong> - tiny spherical packets that sotre high concentrations of neurotransmitter molecules.</p>
<p><strong>MAO (monoamine oxidase)</strong> - Neurons that release serotonin, dopamine, or norepinephrine contain an enzyme, that breaks down these transmitters into inactive chemicals.</p>
