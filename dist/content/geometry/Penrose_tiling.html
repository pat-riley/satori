<p>Non-periodic tiling generated by an aperiodic set of prototiles.</p>
<p>Named after mathematician and physicist Roger Penrose who investigated these sets in the 1970s. </p>
<p>A Penrose titling has many remarkable properties, most notably;</p>
<ul>
<li>It is non-periodic, which means that it lacks any translational symmetry</li>
<li>It is self-similar, so that the same patterns occur at larger and larger scales.Thus, the tiling can be obtained through “inflation” and any finite patch from the tiling occurs infinitely many times.</li>
<li>It is a quasicrystal; implemented as a physical structure a Penrose tiling will produce Bragg diffraction and its diffraction reveals both the fivefold symmetry and the underlying long range order.</li>
</ul>
<p>Various methods to construct Penrose tiling have been discovered, including matching rules, substitution tiling or subdivision rule.</p>
